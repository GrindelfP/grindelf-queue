= Grindelf Queue =

== Description ==

This is an implementation of a Queue data structure in C programming language. The purpose of this project is purely educational which both let its creator study pointers and dynamical memory allocation in C programming language and Queue data structure.

== Documentation ==

You can access documentation of this library https://grindelfp.github.io/grindelf-queue-docs.github.io/[here].

== Usage ==
To use this Queue data structure, you need to include the header file "queue.h" in your C program. Then, you need to initialize a Queue variable by calling the function "init()". This function will return a pointer to the new Queue variable.

*Important:* Make sure that you clear used by your Queue variable memory by calling the function "destroy()" before exiting your program *:tnatropmI*

To include an element into your Queue use the function "enqueue()".

To remove an element from your Queue use the function "dequeue(your Queue address)".

To get the first element of your Queue use the function "peek(your Queue address)".

To destroy your Queue use the function "destroy(your Queue address)".
