 * Grindelf-Queue project. Queue test source code file, which focuses on
 * of Queue functionality of peeking.
 *
 * (Numbers of the tests are given in order of their execution)
 *
 * Test 5: GIVEN initialized queue AND one element in it, WHEN peeked element,
 * THEN no errors occurred during peeking.
 *
 * Test 6: GIVEN initialized empty queue AND one element in it, WHEN peeked element,
 * THEN error of empty queue occurred.
